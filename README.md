# RANSCUMWARE PROJECT

This educational project is a simple ransomware written in Python for learning purposes only. **Do not use this code for any malicious purposes.**

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand how ransomware works at a basic level and to explore the concepts of file encryption and decryption.

## Features
- Encrypts files in a specified directory using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES)
- Generates a unique encryption key for each victim
- Creates a ransom note with instructions for decryption
- Decrypts files upon receiving the correct decryption key
